The public toilet coverage of Bwaise I is about 50 percent . This coverage
leaves many people in dire need of more latrines/toilets. If each 20 people is
to have a toilet, we estimate that between 1,600 and 2,000 toilet are needed
to reach 100 percent coverage in Bwaise I. In the planning for sanitation
facilities for Bwaise I, it is important to give priority to latrine emptying.
This is because there were at least 70 latrines (constituting about 40 percent
of the latrines sampled) in Bwaise that were found full. Thus, if latrines
are installed, and no consideration is given to the emptying, it is likely that
soon or later, all the pits will ll up and the people will no long have access
to functioning latrines. We suggest support in latrine emptying in order to
3
ensure sustainable and functioning latrine facilities for the people of Bwaise
I.
